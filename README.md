# Atari Lunar Lander with Deep Q-Learning

This repository contains an implementation of Deep Q-Learning (DQL) to train an agent to play the Atari game Lunar Lander using Python and TensorFlow.

## Project Description

The project demonstrates the use of reinforcement learning techniques to train an AI agent to play the Atari Lunar Lander game. The agent learns to control the lunar module to land smoothly on the landing pad by optimizing its actions through trial and error using the DQL algorithm.

## Installation Instructions

To run the code in this repository, you need to have Python and the required libraries installed. Follow the instructions below to set up your environment:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/comeasure/Reinforcement-Learning-Projects.git
    cd Reinforcement-Learning-Projects/Lunar-Lander
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```


## Usage Instructions

To run the training script for the Lunar Lander agent:

1. Ensure you have followed the installation instructions above.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Atari_LunarLander.ipynb
    ```
